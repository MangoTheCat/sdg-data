  Passenger and freight volumes is the sum of the passenger and freight volumes reported for the air carriers in terms of number of people and metric tonnes of cargo respectively. The International Transport Forum (ITF) collects data on transport (rail and road) statistics on annual basis
  from all its Member countries. Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate
  tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its
  Statistics Division have established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 191 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry
  stakeholders i,e air carriers and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. Precise definition of all
  different concepts and metadata related to Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. Approved by the ICAO Statistics Division and Member States can be found at the ICAO website -
