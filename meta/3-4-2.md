data_footnote: >-
  Suicide rates per 100,000 population have been age-standardised to allow comparison between populations which may contain different proportions of people of different ages. 
Suicide rates by age are based on age-specific suicide rates per 100,000 population.
Some age-specific rates are potentially unreliable. These figures are denoted with a 'u' in Source 1 and Source 2. Rates were not calculated where there were fewer than 3 death registrations.
