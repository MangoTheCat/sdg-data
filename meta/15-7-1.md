  CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international agreement between governments. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. CITES accords varying
  degrees of protection to more than 35,000 species of animals and plants, whether they are traded as live specimens, fur coats or dried herbs.

Nevertheless, trade in illegal
  wildlife is also facilitated by postal services. Even though the CITES biennial reports provide a detailed overview of the number of seizures made by UK authorities in 2015, significant changes have also been made to the UK national statistics in order to provide an overview of wildlife
  crime at the national level. A new standalone classification was established for wildlife offences including CITES related offences (HM Government 2015). Since April 2014, the number of wildlife crime incidents are recorded and reported separately in the national quarterly crime
  statistics.” http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2016/578963/IPOL_IDA(2016)578963_EN.pdf - UN Data Available - CITES Trade Database. https://trade.cites.org/ - The CITES Trade Database, managed by the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) on behalf of the
