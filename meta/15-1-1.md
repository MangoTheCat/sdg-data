  <p>Forest/woodland - all forest and woodland area over 0.5 hectare with a minimum of 20% canopy cover (25% in Northern Ireland) (or the potential to achieve it) and a minimum width of 20 metres, including areas of new planting, clearfell, windblow and restocked areas. This differs from
  the UN definition for which the minimum canopy cover is 10% (or the potential to achieve it) <p>Woodland certification - Woodland certification assesses management practices against agreed environmental standards. Certification requires that wood products are harvested legally and
  sustainably, and that important wildlife habitats are identified and are not negatively impacted by management.  Woodland certification schemes promote good forest practice and are used to demonstrate that wood or wood products come from well-managed forests.

  Woodland area estimates are based on the <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cd748245-e68c-41e4-bb1a-4728bc64163c/national-forest-inventory-woodland-england-2018">National Forest Inventory (NFI) Woodland map<a/><p>All certified woodland is certified under the Forest Stewardship Council
  (FSC) scheme or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) scheme, with many woodlands certified under both schemes. Certified woodland areas are often used as an indicator of sustainable forest management, however, woodland that is not certified may also be
  sustainably managed. Some choose not to become certified because there is a cost involved in getting certified and there may be little incentive for woodland owners to get their woodlands certified if timber production is not a major objective.<p>Certification in the UK began in 1996.
  Data prior to 2004 are not presented here due to differences in methodology, which mean the data are not directly comparable.<p>New certificates may relate to existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted areas. <p>The land area and forest area measurements
  used here are ‘flat’ as they do not take into account variations in relief e.g. mountains and valleys.  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

####  **At 31 March 2020...**

<ul>
<li><strong>The estimated woodland area as a percentage of total land area in the UK is at the highest point in the last 17 years at 13.2%</strong></li>
<li>The area of woodland in the UK at 31 March 2020 is estimated to be 3.21 million hectares. This represents 10% of the total land area in England, 15% in Wales, 19% in Scotland and 9% in Northern Ireland.</li>
<li>Total woodland area has increased by 6.5% since 2004</li>
<li>43% of woodland area in the UK is certified as sustainably managed</li>
</ul>

#### **Since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 woodland area as a percentage of total land area has increased by 1.6% (UK)**
