**Non-statistical indicator**

We have identified the following policies relevant to this indicator…

[The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (CCA)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/pdfs/ukpga_20040036_en.pdf): Requires Local Authorities (as defined Category 1 responders) to assess
civil contingencies risks and communicate them to the public.

[Emergency Preparedness: Chapter 4 Local responder risk assessment duty (PDF 1.27 MB)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61027/Chapter-4-Local_20Responder-Risk-

[Community resilience framework for practitioners](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-resilience-
framework-for-practitioners): This guidance helps emergency planners ensure communities are central to emergency planning, response and recovery.

The UK’s knowledge platform for disaster risk reduction on [PreventionWeb]( https://www.preventionweb.net/english/countries/europe/gbr/) is
also relevant to this indicator.
