[International Climate Finance (ICF)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-climate-finance) is a UK government commitment to support developing countries to respond to the challenges and opportunities of climate change. UK International Climate Finance plays a crucial role in
addressing this global challenge. Three government Departments (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), Department for International Development (DFID), and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) have responsibility for investing the UK’s £5.8bn of
ICF between 2016 and 2021. The UK has developed a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to capture and track results from ICF programmes. 

The [Prosperity Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cross-government-prosperity-fund-programme/cross-government-prosperity-fund-
update) is a UK cross government initiative that was announced as part of the [2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-security-strategy-and-strategic-defence-and-security-review-2015). It supports the [United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) as well as the [2015 UK Aid Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aid-tackling-global-challenges-in-the-national-interest) by promoting growth and prosperity in developing
countries. In 2017/18, Ministers endorsed 26
multi-year programmes totalling £1.2 billion,
operating between 2016 and 2023, across - investment in
infrastructure and human capital; innovation
and technology; increasing trade; financial
and economic reform; and ease of doing
business.
Priority countries and regions
included - Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Nigeria,
South Africa, China, India and Southeast Asia. See the [Prosperity Fund annual report 2017 to
2018](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/756412/Cross_government_Prosperity_Fund_Annual_Report_2018.pdf) for more detail.

The Department of International Development (DFID) have also initiated the Cities and Infrastructure for
Growth (CIG) programme where the UK have committed to provide up to £165 million between 2017 and 2023 to support economic growth and job creation in Burma, Uganda and Zambia. Progress of this programme can be followed on DFID's [Development
Tracker](https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/projects/GB-1-205222).
