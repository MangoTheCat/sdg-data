target: 11.6 By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management
indicator: 11.6.1
indicator_name: 11.6.1 Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge out of total urban solid waste generated, by cities
national_indicator_available: Proportion of Local Authority collected waste, by waste management type
national_indicator_description: >-
  The reported data source measures the proportion of waste managed using each management type. This is disaggregated by English Region and Local Authority. This source has been identifed as an appropriate proxy for this indicator in collaboration with the topic expert.

computation_definitions: >-
  Landfill estimates include recycling, composting or reuse rejects. 
  
  Incineration with EfW is where EfW is energy from waste. Also included are amounts rejected for recycling, composting or reuse where incineration with EfW is reported as the final destination of these rejects.
  Recycled-composted' includes household and non-household sources sent for recycling or for centralised composting; home composting estimates are not included in this total.  It also includes small amounts of materials sent for reuse.  Material which was collected for recycling but
  actually rejected at collection, by the MRF or at the gate of a recycling reprocessor is excluded. The 'Waste from household' recycling rate has been used. This excludes local authority collected waste types not considered to have come directly from households, such as street bins,
  street sweepings, parks and grounds waste and compost like output (CLO) from Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) plants. 
  
  'Other' includes waste treated-disposed through other unspecified treatment processes as well as process and moisture loss.
computation_calculations: (Amount of waste from selected waste management type in each local authority or region divided by total amount of waste collected in that local authority or region) multiplied by 100.

data_footnote: >-
  1. Where negative values were reported in the published figures, these have been revised to 0.0 due to the limitations of the National Reporting Platform with negative figures. 2. These figures relate only to Local Authority (LA) collected and managed waste, this means the majority of
  commercial waste is not included in these figures. 3. Tables are based on data entered by local authorities onto WasteDataFlow for each quarterly return for 2018-19. WasteDataFlow is a web-based system for quarterly reporting on Local Authority collected waste data by local authorities
  to central government. 4. Data are collected for  each financial year (April to March).
